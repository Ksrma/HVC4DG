# The HVC4DG Algorithm
An O(n^{3/2}logn) exact algorithm for 4-D hypervolume contributions

This is the implementation of our method proposed in:

Jingda Deng, Qingfu Zhang, Jianyong Sun, and Hui Li, "An O(n3/2logn) Exact Algorithm for Computing Hypervolume Contributions in 4-D Space"

which was submitted to IEEE TEVC (under review)

# HVC4DG
The original algorithm described in Section III-B
# HVC4DGS
An improved version of HVC4DG by using the method described in Section III-C
# Test Set
Test sets in the numerical experiments (spherical, cliff and hard instances)
